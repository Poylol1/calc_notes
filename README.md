# calcnotes
notes for my calculus class totally public and fun

there are two main folders pdf and latex
in pdf are the compiled result of the tex files
and to edit just use the tex folder. This is meant
to be for nvim

As dependencies to create this notes I used:
vimtex
tree-sitter latex
markdown.nvim
neovim >= 10.0
zathura
texlive (as compilation engine with latexmk)
Arch linux or the wsl2 arch version. My config is in my
account as a fork of kickstart.nvim!!!
